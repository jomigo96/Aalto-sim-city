# Comments about the plan

The class structure seems well thought out and the diagram presents
the design well, although the plan in general is quite short.

Are there thoughts about user interface and user interaction?

I wouldn't add any new features on the last week, but focus on testing
and fixing bugs.

An alternative for map editor, at least in the beginning, would be to
read the map from a text file that you can create by editor manually.

It would be good if the timing of traffic lights and car behaviors
could be modified, either from UI or from configuration file.

How and when are you testing the project? Are unit tests planned?

On which platforms are you developing and testing the project? Aalto
Linux was an "official" requirement, but if you happen to make it Mac
(Sierra) compatible, I don't complain to be able to test it on my own
laptop.
